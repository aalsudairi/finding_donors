# Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Brief
In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. You will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Install
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scikit-learn


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

I recommend students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
